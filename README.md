# Dependencies

| Dependency | Usage | Installation | Required | 
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) | Command line parsing | `sudo apt install libboost-all-dev` | Yes |
| [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) | Rendering during evaluation | `extern/setup_opencv.sh` <br><br> Please only run if you don't use OpenCV elsewhere. This might cause problems if you have your own OpenCV setup installed, as it compiles OpenCV with the minimal flags needed and overrides the system installation. | `-DWITH_OPENCV=ON` |

## Internal Dependencies

These dependencies are pulled by CMake when the project is built. You `do not` have to install them manually.

| Dependency | Usage | Required | 
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| [YAML-CPP](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git) | YAML parser for objects and pixels | Yes |
| [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) | Google unit testing framework | `-DWITH_TESTS=ON` |
